# Instalation

You can install Committer using the most common package managers for node.js

```bash
# installation with npm

$ npm i -g committer-cli


# installation with yarn

$ yarn global add committer-cli


# installation with pnpm

$ pnpm install -g committer-cli
```

# Using the command line tool

Just type `committer` or `cmt` instead of using `git commit` every time you need to commit some file. You can also type `git-cmt`, as an alias for `committer`.

Select the files you want to commit:

Note: for each different keyword you choose, you will have differents items in this list.

Type a short message for your commit (it's highly recommended a message with more than 4 words)

Whether you want, you can add a more detailed description talking about the changes that were made.

Note: the option for add a more detailed description is "No" for default.

And finnaly, commit changes to the default branch
